'''
A test suite of unit tests for the plantpredict-python package.

It is assumed that the plantpredict package is in the python path, and `mock` is installed. Note: mock could not be installed through conda, used pip instead.

To run all tests, from the `tests` directory, do:

```
python -m unittest discover -v
```
